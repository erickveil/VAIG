# TODO:

- [ ] Add a goal to end 10 turns in a "happy" state - initial test kept the goblin alive 10 turns, but the goblin was not happy.
- [ ] Format output - Let output parse the newlines, and also put a newline and turn counter at the start of each turn, and a newline between Falken and the game's output.
- [ ] Allow multiple statuses?

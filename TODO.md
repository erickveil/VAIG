# TODO:

- [ ] Clarify in the prompt that higher values are good and lower values are bad, as Falken sees "High hunger" as bad (understandably).
- [ ] Add a prompt to end 10 turns in a "happy" state - initial test kept the goblin alive 10 turns, but the goblin was not happy.
- [ ] Zero Bladder should make the goblin "pee itself" and lower hygene and environment accordingly - but restore bladder.
- [ ] Format output - Let output parse the newlines, and also put a newline and turn counter at the start of each turn, and a newline between Falken and the game's output.

## "Virtual AI Goblin"

This is a zero-player game that is played by an LLM AI.

Currently, I am using a local Ollama installation to play the game. It is using Ollama's context, so if ChatGPT were used, it would not have a continous context to play with.

The Game itself is like a Tamagotchi - The AI is given a goblin with various needs, and it has commands to issue the goblin to take care of them. 

I'm going to test this with various goals, but for now, we just need to keep the goblin alive for 10 days.

The game is all in the console - you see an output of the game state and the AI's commands and musings during each turn.
